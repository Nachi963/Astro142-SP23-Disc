### If you want to define functions, those should be here (not in main)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	### Load the array you made in homework 1
	data = np.load(FIXME)

	### Make a figure and add a main panel. 
	### Leave some space for adding two colorbars later


	### Plot with imshow (consider playing with the colormap/scaling) in the main panel


	### Overlay the image with a contour plot. Experiment with 
	### color maps/levels so that the contours are clear. Add labels to your 
	### contours https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/contour_label_demo.html 


	### Create two new axes. In each one, add a color bar, one for 
	### the contour plot and one for the image. Make sure the scales
	### match and the axis labels are big enough to read


	### Add a semi-transparent circular patch inscribing the central region. Name
	### the patch something and add a legend in the upper-left corner with
	### no bounding box

	### Save your plot as a pdf (however far you get) and upload it for the discussion assignment
